Python Project: ATM Simulator
( The program begins with a welcoming message and prompts for the user's PIN. Once authenticated, it presents a menu of options. During development, I focused on ensuring user security with PIN validation and limiting incorrect attempts. I prioritized clear instructions and intuitive design to enhance user experience. Input validation was crucial to handle various scenarios, and error messages were crafted to guide users effectively. The result is a functional and user-friendly ATM simulation.)
